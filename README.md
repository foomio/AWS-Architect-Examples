## Introduction

This repository serves as a portfolio to demonstrate my AWS architect skills. It includes a variety of sample projects that showcase my ability to design and implement solutions using AWS services.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each dedicated to a specific category of AWS projects. Here's a brief overview of the categories:

- `01-infra-as-code`: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) examples using AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK.
- `02-serverless-apps`: Serverless application examples using AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and other related services.
- `03-databases`: Demonstrations of database setup and management with Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, and other AWS database services.
- `04-networking`: Examples of AWS networking, including Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configurations and connectivity options.
- `05-security`: AWS security practices, focusing on AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and security best practices.
- `06-monitoring-logging`: Monitoring and logging setups using AWS CloudWatch and related services.
- `07-data-processing-analytics`: Data processing and analytics pipelines with AWS Glue, Amazon EMR, or Amazon Redshift.
- `08-containers-orchestration`: Containerization projects using Amazon ECS, EKS, or Fargate.
